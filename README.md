# 🔢 Digit Recognition using Python

This project implements a **Digit Recognition System** using machine learning to recognize handwritten digits from images. It uses either a custom-trained model or pre-trained datasets like MNIST.

---

## 🎯 Features

- 🧠 Uses a trained ML model (e.g., KNN, CNN, or SVM) to classify handwritten digits
- 📝 Can predict digits from static images or real-time webcam input (if OpenCV is used)
- 📊 Includes training, testing, and evaluation of model accuracy
- ✅ Easy to run and extend

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn or TensorFlow/Keras
- Matplotlib (for plotting)
- OpenCV (optional, for real-time or image input)
- MNIST dataset (from `sklearn` or `tensorflow.datasets`)
